Ellucian built our Web Front End on ASP.NET Web Forms, a technology released in2002 that has since been succeeded several times over. Moreover, their work is essentially black-boxed to us. Our developer may be able to jerry-rig a process on top of Ellucians, but what about the next time? A patch over our patch? No, Regent needs software that is as responsive, dynamic, and flexible as we are. I propose:"

    "value": "There is a way of developing software that is what I’ll call “murky”. The intent of such development appears to be to make the engineering of the application so obfuscated, undocumented, and difficult to modify and extend that the user simply must depend on the vendors to make any changes other than the ones explicitly planned for. Ellucian is very good at this sort of development, and, you must admit, it’s worked as a business model. I’m not suggesting we only use Open Source Software; Dynamics CRM itself is proprietary. The difference is that Dynamics is transparent: through Microsoft’s easy-to-use API’s and extensive documentation, we are practically as unbounded as our creativity to extend on modify our system to our needs. This is not a convenience but an absolute necessity, as the technical challenges we face tomorrow likely don’t even exist today.  Whatever solution is developed for the WFE, if it’s not understood, well-documented, and extensible, then it’s not really a solution."

While some decorating with CSS will go a long way, ASP.NET Web Forms won’t deliver the responsiveness and sleekness that that our users are growing accustomed to through Facebook, Netflix, Gmail, etc. These are Single Page Applications (SPA’s), and they are where I believe the Web is going, and where I believe we should too."

Contracting to develop software that we don’t understand and can’t modify, then reverse-engineering that software to make it work for us is more difficult and more expensive. We’ve already contracted a Web Developer proficient in the cutting edge of web technology (Node + Angular,  ASP.NET MVC, etc.); why not leverage his skills to write us software that is modern, responsive, and most importantly, that we own, understand, and can extend?"

    "value": "Notice that every submission in the WFE triggers a page refresh (where the new “spinner” receives unfortunate display). In contrast, an application like Gmail can navigate hundreds of emails without a single page refresh. Instead, they send you one page that can handle the viewing, entering, and validating of data in your browser, keeping communication between client and server to the very minimum necessary. Besides making for very responsive pages, this makes the entire system easier to develop and maintain, as the look, feel, and behavior of the web application is completely independent of the back-end server’s infrastructure. The back-end could change applications, architectures, or even operating systems with minimal effect, and vice versa. If the technicalities of the design are not convincing, just compare the sheer popularity, support and tooling of the two methodologies. Just for comparison, I searched Google Trends for ASP.NET Web Forms, and compared it to Angular and React, the two most popular Front End Frameworks for SPA’s. The results (below) are quite telling."
  },
  {
    "key": "text",
    "value": "Popularity doesn’t say everything, but surely it must say something. There’s a reason the zeitgeist is moving towards these front-end frameworks: besides the technical advantages they’re created and backed by the internet giants Google and Facebook (Angular and React, respectively), who compete to provide the easiest learning curve, best tooling, and most responsive support communities the internet has ever seen. I’m not one to hastily jump on the bandwagon, but I happen to really like where this one is going, and it’s going there fast. Regent stays ahead of the curve, and we should stay ahead of this one. "
